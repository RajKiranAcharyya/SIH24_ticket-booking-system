Ticket Booking System For Museums
This project implements a multilingual chatbot-based ticket booking system for museums. It allows users to book tickets, select seats, and make payments with dynamic pricing based on peak/off-peak times. The system features real-time seat availability, OAuth 2.0 authentication for secure login, and integrates Stripe for payment processing. The project supports personal guide booking, exhibition rentals, and event scheduling. Built using Python for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend, it also offers multilingual support and tracks user interactions for enhanced experience and analytics.
